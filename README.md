# survivalGames
A plugin that creates then spawns all players to a border of 600 x 600 blocks with the command /locationBorder. After 15 minutes, 
the border will close for 5 minutes, forcing the players together to fight in a 32 x 32 blocked area. 
If a player dies, they will automatically be put into Spectator Mode.
